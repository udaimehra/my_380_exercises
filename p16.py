#The quadratic equation is given with the following formula:
#x^2+5x+4=0
#X^2-(-4+(-1))x+((-4)*(-1))=0
#Using Vieta's formulas calculate the sum and product of the roots of this quadratic equation. 
#Print the result to the console as shown below.
#
x1 = -4.0
x2 = -1.0
m = x1*x2
s = x1+x2
print(f'x1 + x2 = {s:.1f}')
print(f'x1x2 = {m:.1f}')
